# Visualizing-Data
Create a graphical visualization of the enrollment frequency (by major) of a course. The visualization should display circles with centered text labels identifying the major. The areas of the circles should be proportional to the percentage of students with that major enrolled in the course.
All circles should have proportionally correct areas.
The circumference line and the text label of each circle should be colored with a matching randomly chosen color. 
All circles should be placed with their centers at randomly chosen (x, y) coordinates but the circles must be completely contained within the graphics area.
